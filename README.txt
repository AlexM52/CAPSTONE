Just so things are a little clearer:

the code in this folder is the php I have so far. All the _starter* files are
mainly just reference for code to go into the applicable pages.

session_code_reference was also just a file with example code for reference.

I was testing some code in login.php and using req.html to send test requests.

sca_php_lib.php is supposed to be a single php header file with some common
functions and settings/variables, so we can just import it into all php pages
instead of having to rewrite the same code repeatedly.

Work in progress. Will try and get updated versions of everything up. Just 
putting this so you all can see what's going on with it.
